## Abstract

This project aims to discover if there has been a decline in English Language Arts (ELA) comprehension and abilities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This research investigates at all 32 school districts in New York City across grades three through eight. The years that will be compared are 2018, 2019, and 2022, as state-wide exams were not held during the pandemic. The data includes the mean score of state-administered testing for each year, grade, and school. Furthermore, this data provides insights about the percentage of students who fall into different score ranges which categorizes academic ability. The data and school district GeoJSON was sourced from the City of New York website. Both multivariate data analysis and geographic analysis will be performed to assess pr and post COVID ELA comprehension. Multivariate data analysis will assess the means of scores for each grade. Geographical analysis aims to assess trends amongst school districts and socioeconomic demographics of each region. I hope to gain valuable insights on the effects of ELA comprehension due to learning loss from online learning.
